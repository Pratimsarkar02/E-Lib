        <h2 id="team">Team</h2>
<p>This E-Library is developed by a small group of members, new to this field of a fully responsive inventory based Stand-alone Management System Development . We're actively looking to grow as a team and would love to hear from you if you're excited about our site. </p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This project was developed by Pratim Sarkar(Front-End), Aditya Prasad(Front-End), Akshat Kumar(Back-End), Prince Gupta(Back-End) and Shohel Alam(Testing). This project idea had been one of the most popular among other project ideas.</p>

<p>This Project was designed in ASP.NET using C#, bootstrap framework (Front-End Styling), and mySQL 2017 in the Back-End. Prior to being an open-sourced framework, Bootstrap was known as Twitter Blueprint. Having said that, this site also helped in providing tremendous CSS and JavaScript files. A few months into development, it formed in the desired shape as developers of that skill levels jumped in with intitutional guidance. It will be served as the digital guide for books' stock management of the Institute for the upcoming years.</p>

<h2 id="get-involved">Support</h2>
<p>With the continuous support from the faculty and proper moniterization, this project is seemed to have fulfilled the desired shape as a whole. Sincere gratitute to the HoD of Computer Science, Mrs. Seema Lama, Project Guide, Mr. Rupak Kr. Nirola and the rest of the Computer Science faculty of Darjeeling Polytechnic.</p>

<p>Special Thanks to the Librarian of Darjeeling Polytechnic, Mr. Pinaki Banik for suggesting the required modules to add-on, because this will be helpul for him to maintain the pen-paper based Library Management digitally.</p>
